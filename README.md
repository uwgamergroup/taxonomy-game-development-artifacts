| **Description**    | The term ‘artifact’ is commonly used by game developers and other individuals working in video game production settings, so as to adequately describe the diverse nature of these information objects while simultaneously legitimizing them as objects worthy of preservation and study; based upon literary warrant and a desire to further legitimize these artifacts, we have intentionally chosen to refer to the information objects created and used by game developers as ‘artifacts.’ |
